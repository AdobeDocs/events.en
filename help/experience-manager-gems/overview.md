We will start with the integration steps, which will allow developers to integrate the AEM Assets repository into the site authoring flow. Then we will demonstrate how developers can customize the integration based on site-specific authoring requirements. We'll also show how the assets can be delivered using AEM Dynamic Media with Open API, allowing you to leverage Dynamic Media Open API features. Additionally, we will dive into practical use cases and best practices, providing a comprehensive understanding of how this integration helps in leveraging your asset management solution in your site authoring flows.</p>

We will start with the repository onboarding, which will now allow you to directly link the GitHub repository to your Cloud Manager pipelines, eliminating the need to consistently sync your code with the Adobe repository. Then we want to showcase how this feature allows you to shift-left your testing process, bringing the Cloud Manager code quality checks at the pull request level before the code is merged. This way, as an AEM developer, you would be able to identify the issues that would have failed your Cloud Manager build sooner in your development cycle.</p>
