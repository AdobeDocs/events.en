# AEM Best Practices Analyzer for on premise and AMS environments

## This webinar has been delivered on January 18, 2023 - please view the recording below

## Description

The Best Practices Analyzer is a tool that provides analysis and reporting capabilities regarding AEM on premise and AMS instances. It generates an assessment of your current AEM implementation by indicating areas that are not following recommended best practices while also providing guidance on how to take action to remedy potential issues. The motivation is simple; identifying and addressing just 1 misuse within your AEM environment has the potential of improving user-experience, reducing technical debt and in-turn lowering your total cost of ownership (TCO). So why not take the time to see if there are improvement opportunities. 
Note that the AEM Best Practices Analyzer is not applicable for AEM as a Cloud Service environments.
