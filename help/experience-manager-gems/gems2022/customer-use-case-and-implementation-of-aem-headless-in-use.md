# AEM GEMs feature - Customer Use Case & Implementation of AEM Headless in Use

*This webinar has been conducted on **Wednesday, October 12th - 3pm UTC**. The recording is available below.*

This exceptional AEM GEMs session features two speakers who are operating AEM as customers. The session will be split in two halves as follows:

## Part 1: AEM as a headless CMS Where/When/Why? 

Presenter: Vengadesh Shanmugavelu - Technical Architect, Qatar Airways

**Session description:**
There are many ways by which we can implement headless CMS via AEM. 
In this session, we will cover the following: 

* Content services via exporter/servlets
* Content fragment via asset API (demo)
* Content fragment via graphql (demo)
* Some real-time use cases around using content fragments and their approaches
* SPA Editor learnings (Some solution approach on when to choose) (demo)

## Part 2: Deliver headless content through GraphQL API and Content Fragments

Presenter: Debal Das - Senior System Analyst, IBM

**Session description:**
In this session, we will cover GraphQL consumption of content fragments (besides the already existing JSON APIs).

Conceptually, GraphQL is similar to a SQL database query, with the exception that an API is utilized for the query rather than a database.

This eliminates the requirement for the API to provide many endpoints delivering various volumes or groups of data for various customers and enables various clients to query the API for their own needs.
