* **Configuration** Configuration options include selecting the IAM repository, setting SKU values, and using the asset selector image client ID.

* **Customization** Adobe Express can be used to edit images, including AI functionalities for modifications.
* **Metadata and Synchronization** Metadata fields like SKU and image roles are used to associate images with products, and updates are synchronized within 1-2 minutes.
* **Event-Driven Architecture** The integration uses Adobe IO events and an event-driven architecture to synchronize assets between IAM assets and Adobe Commerce.
* **Compatibility** The integration is compatible with PBB checkout, Control Pins, and B2B widgets, leveraging GraphQL APIs.
* **Customization Options** Developers can customize the asset matching rules using AI Builder applications.
* **Setup Requirements** Requires a running media license, support ticket for dynamic media with open API, and merging the public repository asset commerce code base.
