## Key takeaways

* **Universal Editor Overview** Universal Editor is designed to solve the problem of headless content management by allowing authors to create content in context with a live preview. ​
* **Technology Support** It supports any implementation, technology, or type of content, allowing developers to use various tech stacks like React, Angular, etc. ​
* **Developer Flexibility** Developers can control policies and customize the authoring experience through hooks and extensions without needing to run pipelines or compile code. ​
* **Edge Delivery Services** The Universal Editor integrates with edge delivery services, providing in-context live preview authoring. ​
* **Consolidation of Editors** Universal Editor aims to consolidate various editors (e.g., spy editor, remote spot editor, content fragment editor) into a single platform. ​
* **Block-Based Authoring** Blocks are used to define chunks of content with specific styling and functionality, which can be managed by developers. ​
* **JSON Configuration** In AEM authoring, blocks are defined by JSON files, which specify the content model and how it appears in the editor. ​
* **Extensibility with App Builder** Extensions can be created using App Builder to add custom functionalities to the Universal Editor. ​
* **Dynamic Media Assets** The process of adding dynamic media assets involves editing JSON files and deploying changes to a branch for testing.
* **Simplified Customization** Customizing the Universal Editor is simpler compared to the OG editor, as it does not require running pipelines or extensive setup. ​
