## Key takeaways

* **Introduction of a New Feature** Adriana Clayton from Adobe introduced a new feature in AMP Cloud Manager called "Bring Your Own Git."
* **Purpose of the Feature** The feature is designed to optimize deployment workflows, making them faster, more efficient, and adaptable to preferred vendors.
* **Challenges Addressed** The feature addresses the complexity of synchronizing external Git repositories with Adobe Git repositories, which adds extra steps and time to the deployment process.
* **Solution Provided** "Bring Your Own Git" allows direct connection of private and public external Git repositories to Cloud Manager pipelines, enabling immediate perception of code changes and running actions before code merging.
* **Shift Left Strategy** The integration supports a shift-left strategy, allowing code quality checks to be run earlier in the development process, providing timely feedback to developers.
* **Demo and Validation** A demo was provided showing how to integrate repositories and validate them using Cloud Manager, including steps for GitHub and Bitbucket repositories.
* **Customer Impact** Since its general availability, over 130 customers have onboarded their repositories, preventing more than 2500 pull requests with code quality issues from reaching production.
* **Future Enhancements** Plans to expand the feature to include reports directly in GitLab and Bitbucket, and to extend "Bring Your Own Git" to edge delivery services for more flexibility.
* **Encouragement for Feedback** Customers are encouraged to provide feedback and participate in the early adopter phase for non-GitHub repositories.
