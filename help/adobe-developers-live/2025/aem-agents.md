# Introducing Adobe Experience Manager Agents

Adobe Developers Live 2025: Building the Agentic Web brought together developers, architects, and technologists across San Jose, Sydney, Bangalore, and Basel to explore how AI and Edge Delivery Services are redefining digital experiences with Adobe Experience Manager and Commerce.

Recorded live from San Jose, this session introduces Adobe Experience Manager Agents, an AI-powered capability that transforms website migration. With seamless GitHub integration, AEM Agents automate block mapping, content import, and styling into clean, best-practice code—accelerating onboarding to Edge Delivery Services. Learn how developers can simplify migrations, reduce delivery time, and launch sites optimized for search and generative engines.
