description: Learn workflows and tips for faster deployments with Rapid Development Environments (RDE)Rapid Development Environments (RDE) for AEM as a Cloud Service improve the developer experience by allowing them to swiftly deploy and review changes, minimizing the amount of time needed to test features. RDEs support iterative development scenarios, for example to update Java code, configurations, scripts, content and dispatcher configurations. The changes are directly applied to those running instances. In this session, we will look at RDEs in detail and show how developers can take advantage of them to deploy experimental changes directly, test their content and code during development, and get quick feedback on their changes using a real cloud environment.

Learn workflows and tips for faster deployments with Rapid Development Environments (RDE)

Rapid Development Environments (RDE) for AEM as a Cloud Service improve the developer experience by allowing them to swiftly deploy and review changes, minimizing the amount of time needed to test features. RDEs support iterative development scenarios, for example to update Java code, configurations, scripts, content and dispatcher configurations. The changes are directly applied to those running instances. In this session, we will look at RDEs in detail and show how developers can take advantage of them to deploy experimental changes directly, test their content and code during development, and get quick feedback on their changes using a real cloud environment. â†’ Continue the conversation at: https://adobe.ly/3HACjKm
