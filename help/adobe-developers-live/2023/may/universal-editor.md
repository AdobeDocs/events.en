title: Author Anything with Universal Editor
description: Author Anything with Universal EditorUnderstand how your own existing headless apps can easily instrument the UE to bring low-friction in-context editing to the fingertip of your authors. The Universal Editor is the next generation of AEM in-context page editor and it solves the current limitations of the AEM Page Editor or SPA Editor. It is independent of frameworks, rendering engines, and data sources - thus providing all the freedom the developers are seeking and making it truly universal. All it requires is a rendered HTML with the required instrumentation, but allows the implementation to still be fully decoupled from AEM. In this session, you will be introduced to the new Universal Editor, we'll walk through the currently available features, and a demo will showcase how a simple app can be made editable on the Universal Editor.

It is independent of frameworks, rendering engines, and data sources - thus providing all the freedom the developers are seeking and making it truly universal. All it requires is a rendered HTML with the required instrumentation, but allows the implementation to still be fully decoupled from AEM. In this session, you will be introduced to the new Universal Editor, we'll walk through the currently available features, and a demo will showcase how a simple app can be made editable on the Universal Editor. â†’ Continue the conversation at: https://adobe.ly/3njEDyy
