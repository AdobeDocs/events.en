## Unlocking Lead Scoring Success

Lead scoring transforms raw marketing data into actionable insights, helping organizations prioritize prospects and align sales and marketing efforts.

* Scoring bridges the gap between marketing and sales, ensuring only qualified leads are passed to sales teams.
* Behavioral and demographic scoring work together to identify both interest and fit, improving conversion rates.
* Negative scoring and score decay prevent overinflation and keep scores relevant to current engagement.
* Marketo offers flexible tools for building, testing, and refining scoring models, with templates and community support.

Understanding and applying these principles can drive more efficient lead management and higher revenue velocity.
