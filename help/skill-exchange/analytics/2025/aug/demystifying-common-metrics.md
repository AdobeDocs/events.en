# Demystifying Common Metrics

There are a number of metrics that we all use every day. In this session I’ll go over what they actually mean and how to use them most effectively. It will cover some out of the box metrics like visits and visitors and even go into some calculated metrics like conversion rate and bounce rate.

## Bounce Rate vs. Single Page Visits

* A **bounce** is a visit with exactly one hit (e.g., only a page load, no interaction).
* A **single page** visit is a visit with only one unique page seen, but may include multiple hits (e.g., pop-ups, cookie prompts).
* Adobe's default bounce rate can undercount true bounces if extra calls fire on the first page.
* Creating a custom bounce rate using single page visits offers a clearer picture of disengaged users.
* Use entries instead of visits for page-level bounce analysis to refine accuracy.

## Unlocking the Power of Web Analytics Metrics

Discover how to make sense of the most common web analytics metrics and use them to drive better business decisions.

* **Metric Definitions** Learn the distinctions between unique visitors, visits, page views, page events, and occurrences.
* **Bounce Rate Insights** Understand the subtle differences between bounces and single page visits, and why custom bounce rates can be more accurate.
* **Conversion Rate Clarity** See how conversion rate, orders per visit, and order success differ, and why choosing the right metric matters.
* **Bot Traffic Awareness** Find out how bot metrics help you identify and filter out non-human traffic for cleaner reporting.

Mastering these concepts will help you select the best metrics for your needs and maximize the value of your analytics reporting.
