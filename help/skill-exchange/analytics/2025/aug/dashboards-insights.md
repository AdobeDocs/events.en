# Why Dashboards Don’t Deliver Insights (And What Actually Does)

“We need a dashboard that gives us insights.” Sound familiar? The truth is, dashboards aren’t designed to deliver insights—they're just the starting point.

In this session, you’ll learn a practical framework using three distinct tools—dashboards, narrative reports, and deep analysis—to actually uncover the why behind the numbers. Walk away with a clear system to turn data into action and finally escape the endless cycle of empty dashboards.

## Transforming Data into Meaningful Action

Unlocking the power of data requires more than just dashboards—it demands a system that turns observations into actionable insights.

* **Insight Defined** An insight is a shift in understanding that reveals critical patterns or anomalies and, when applied in context, drives meaningful change.
* **Three-Layer System** Dashboards (binoculars) spot trends, narrative reports (magnifying glass) add context, and deep analysis (microscope) delivers recommendations.
* **Key Ingredients** Patterns, anomalies, and context must intersect for true insights to emerge.
* **Actionable Outcomes** Prioritization frameworks and closing the loop on business impact ensure insights lead to measurable improvements.

This approach helps users move from static data to dynamic, business-changing decisions—making analytics truly valuable.

## Defining True Insights

* Insights are not just data points—they require both a pattern/anomaly and the right context.
* Four key triggers for insights:
  * **Connections** Uncovering relationships between previously unrelated data.
  * **Contradictions** Spotting inconsistencies between expectations and reality.
  * **Coincidences** Identifying unexpected alignments or correlations.
  * **Curiosities** Investigating anomalies that defy expectations.
* Without context, even the most interesting data is just noise.
* Actionable insights drive change and must be measurable to demonstrate value.
