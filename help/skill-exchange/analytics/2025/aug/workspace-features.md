## Unlocking Advanced Analytics Techniques

Explore how Adobe Analytics Workspace empowers users to extract deeper insights and optimize dashboards,

* **Conditional Formatting** Instantly spot trends and outliers in freeform tables without exporting to Excel.
* **Dropdown Panels** Make dashboards dynamic and interactive, reducing duplication and improving usability.
* **Attribution Models** Move beyond last touch to understand the full customer journey and influence measurement.
* **Calculated Metrics & Functions** Use advanced math and logic to uncover hidden patterns and segment data for actionable insights.

These strategies help users transform raw data into meaningful, actionable information, supporting smarter decision-making and more effective reporting.

## Enhancing Dashboards with Dropdowns

* **Static Dropdowns** Fixed list of dimension values; good for historical or unchanging filters.
* **Dynamic Dropdowns** Auto-updates as data changes; ideal for evolving dimensions like weekly filters.
* Eliminates need to duplicate panels for different views (e.g., device type, country).
* Dynamic dropdowns remove deleted values upon refresh, while static retain original selections.
* Improves dashboard interactivity and user experience for stakeholders.
