# Shortcut Across the Data-Verse: Get Your Data to PowerPoint at Warp Speed

Love it or hate it, PowerPoint presentations are a common request from upper management: a few visualizations that they can add into their weekly or monthly slide decks. Often this means a lot of effort for us on the data side to repeat menial steps taking screen shots and trying to align them to look attractiveâ€¦ Instead, let's jump in our ship and take a wormhole to get to the result easier, bypassing the asteroid fields and space pirates.

In this session, I'll walk through ways to uncover unused or redundant components, identify low-hanging cleanup opportunities, and create a cleaner, more performant workspace environment. Whether you're after faster load times, better governance, or prepping for a platform migration, this session will give you practical tools and tips to tidy things up.
