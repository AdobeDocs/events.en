# Data Storytelling With Analysis Workspace

Dashboards are great, but too often they don't drive any impact. In this session, we’ll walk through how to turn your Adobe Analysis Workspace projects into real data stories that get noticed and drive action.

You’ll learn how to use visualizations more intentionally, ask better questions (with help from AI), and layer in techniques like the 5 Whys to dig deeper into what really matters. By the end, you’ll be able to build dashboards that guide your audience to the “so what” and help them make faster, better decisions.

## Unlocking Impactful Data Storytelling

Discover how to move beyond traditional reporting and create dashboards that drive real stakeholder action.

* **Storytelling Drives Action** Stakeholders respond to insight, urgency, and emotional relevance, not just raw data.
* **Narrative Structure Matters** Use setup, tension, and resolution to guide users through your dashboard, mirroring effective storytelling.
* **Visuals and Context** Advanced visualizations and contextual text help users focus on what matters and build emotional engagement.
* **Presentation is Key** The way you present your data story can make or break its impact—personal delivery adds emotion and clarity.

Applying these principles will help you create dashboards that are not only informative but also inspire meaningful decisions.

## Visual Hierarchy and Narrative Arc

* Structure dashboards like stories begin with a setup (key stat or situation), introduce tension (why issues exist), and resolve with recommendations.
* Guide users through the dashboard as if reading a story, ensuring each section builds context and emotion.
* Use section headers, hide unnecessary titles, and add images or logos for professional branding.
* Align dashboard flow to stakeholder needs, making the narrative clear and actionable.
