# An Introduction to Boards

Have you incorporated Adobe Workfront Boards into your collaboration toolkit?

Boards allow teams to manage work in a more visual way by creating a virtual board to display tasks, projects, and other work items. Whether you are a System Admin, a Project Manager, or an individual contributor, Boards offers a flexible and intuitive way to manage work.

Cynthia Boon, Customer Success Manager at Workfront (and former customer!), will walk through an introduction to Boards and the built-in templates.

In addition, sheâ€™ll cover,

* Common uses for boards, including how to show task statuses
* Different ways to visualize work, from ad hoc tasks to more complex project tracking
* How Boards can be used to bridge the gap between theoretical brainstorming and actual project plans
* Ideas for using Boards to increase Workfront adoption and engagement
