# Experience Makers Spotlight

The onboarding, up-skilling and enablement of users in Workfront is an ongoing task for System Admins. Have you ever wondered how other organizations are tackling it?

Join our Experience Makers Spotlight session to hear from three very different organizations about their approaches, and what they wish they had known when they were first starting out.

You'll hear,

* An overview of how Steven Enos, Senior Operations Analyst at Liberty Mutual Insurance uses customized Layout Templates to make the experience for every new user as simple as possible as they onboard into Workfront
* How Amy Franz, Workflow Management Director at Fidelity Investments, leverages a council of internal ambassadors to amplify the voices of her users and create an ongoing loop of training and feedback
