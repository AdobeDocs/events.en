# Purpose Driven Automations

Leveraging automations can unlock tremendous potential for efficiency by allowing your users to focus on the work that requires their unique skills and expertise, instead of the routine and repetitive tasks that bog can them down.

During this session, Jennafer Higgs, Jonathan Cabre, and Malcom Benites from Zimmerman Advertising will share practical examples of automations proven to create a more efficient workflow.

They'll share both Fusion and non-Fusion automations, including:

· How to automatically close projects
· Sub-template generation
· Consolidated approved asset review
