# Maturing Workfront Across the Enterprise

This session will look at some of the foundational requirements and improvement insights for growing a Workfront Implementation into an Enterprise implementation. We will focus on key data elements and objects, as well as converting from “in the box” Workfront functionality to leveraging Enterprise systems (such as an ERP).

Dale Whitchurch, EVP, Production Intelligence, at IPG Health, will share how he and his team have integrated multiple technologies into Workfront to automate workflows and evolved processes at IPG Health.

You’ll hear,

How they have evolved both their process and infrastructure over time
Practical advice for integrating Workfront into your broader tech stack and maturing key workflows
How IPG is laying the groundwork for Content Supply Chain
