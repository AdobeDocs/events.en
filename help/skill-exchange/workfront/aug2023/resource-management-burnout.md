# Tackle Burnout with Resource Management

It's no secret that when teams are burned out at work, productivity decreases, errors increase, and engagement levels drop. Not only is this bad for an employee's health and wellness, but it can also lead to higher turnover rates and hamper innovation and creativity within the team.

There are many ways to tackle burnout, but when it comes to work management, organizations need visibility into both the work being planned AND the resources available to execute.

In this session, Tia Calvert, Product Manager, and Erin Kuchera, Creative Operations Manager, at Mayo Clinic, will share:

* Why using Planned Hours and Task Assignments in Workfront are key to managing resources
* How to incorporate time off tracking
* Examples of how Mayo Clinic uses Analytics and Resource Manager to provide transparency to teams, and plan for new work
