# Beginner’s Guide to Native Integrations

Did you know Adobe Workfront has native, no-cost integrations with Adobe Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud?

The Adobe Workfront + Creative Cloud integration allows your team to see their Workfront projects and priorities right in Creative Cloud, eliminating interruptions and giving them more time for what they do best: be creative. Connecting Workfront with AEM Assets through Adobe’s new native integration is critical to metadata integrity and optimizes the way content flows between these systems.

Shannon McDonnell and Jeff Herrington from the Adobe Workfront Product Management team will share an overview of these integrations and how you can start taking advantage of them today.

They'll share,

* An introduction to Workfront native integrations for Creative Cloud and AEM Assets within the Adobe content supply chain strategy
