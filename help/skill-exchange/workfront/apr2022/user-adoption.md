# Considerations for Conquering User Adoption

Adoption of a work management solution like Workfront has many facets, but one of the most foundational is to understand who in your organization will be using it and how to help them understand what’s in it for them.

In this session, we’ll take a deeper look at exactly who we’re centering our adoption efforts around (i.e. “the who”) and identify and consider common obstacles organizations face as to “the why” of adoption.

We’ll cover:

* 5 major personas that cannot be discounted in your approach to adoption
* Key obstacles routinely associated with Workfront adoption that need to be considered (and over time, considered again!)
* Review resources to assist you in conquering end user adoption of Workfront (or reengage users who may have become complacent or detached)
