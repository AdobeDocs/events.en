# Learn Track - Experience Makers Spotlight

Have you ever wanted to peek behind the curtain to see how some of the biggest brands in the world manage their work?

Join our Experience Makers Spotlight session to hear from three very different organizations about how they use Workfront. They’ll talk about their journey, and, as a bonus, each of our presenters will share their best piece of “what I wish I had known” advice.

You’ll hear:

* How Esri leverage reports to improve the user experience and measure marketing KPIs
* Lessons learned from a scrappy team within Capital One who turned their pilot of Workfront into a large-scale rollout across the entire organization
* Three ways - other than Marketing! - that Inland Empire Health Plan uses Workfront
