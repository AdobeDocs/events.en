## Avoid Naming Convention Pitfalls

| Problem                | Why It Happens                | Solution                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Long, confusing names  | Manual naming conventions     | Use tags & categories     |
| Inconsistent execution | Human error in naming         | Enforce tag governance    |
| Hard to find journeys  | Overly detailed names         | Filter by tags            |
| Reporting challenges   | Reliance on names for reports | Combine tags + concise names |

## Set Up Effective Alerts

Alerts help you catch problems early, but setting them up wisely is key:

* Use platform alerts for technical failures (like custom actions breaking).
* Subscribe to email notifications for critical issues, not just FYI updates.
* Set thresholds (e.g., error rate above 5%) to avoid alert overload.
* For journey expiration, use calendar reminders or workflow tools if the platform doesnâ€™t support it directly.

Smart alert management keeps your team focused on what matters most.
