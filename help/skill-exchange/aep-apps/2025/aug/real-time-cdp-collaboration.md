* **Set Up Publisher Partnerships** Choose publishers (like NBCU or Roku) and complete any required legal agreements for data sharing.
* **Discover and Activate Audiences** Use the CDP to find audience overlaps, build lookalike groups, and securely send these to publishers for targeted campaigns.
* **Measure and Optimize** Track results using both online and offline data, then adjust your strategy based on what works best for your goals.
