## Transforming Analytics with CJA: Key Takeaways

Discover how Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) revolutionizes digital analytics workflows:

* **Flexible Data Management** CJA allows real-time, retroactive changes to data logic, eliminating rigid structures and delays from Adobe Analytics.
* **Enhanced Marketing Channel Setup** Instantly update, QA, and persist marketing channel rules with up to 200 customizable rules and regex support.
* **Streamlined Classifications & List Variables** Easily classify, split, and analyze complex data using derived fields, lookups, and array conversions—no more workarounds or variable limits.
* **Practical Guidance** Includes troubleshooting tips, onboarding advice, and leveraging AI for faster insights.

These insights empower users to modernize analytics, reduce manual effort, and unlock richer, more actionable data for marketing and business decisions.

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Marketing Channels

* Create a derived field in your CJA data view for marketing channels using function templates.
* Customize rules (up to 200, with regex and any data source) and adjust order/logic anytime.
* Instantly apply and retroactively update changes—no more waiting for admin processing.
* QA by hiding new components until validated, then drag into reports for immediate use.
* Duplicate dimensions to test different persistence windows (e.g., session, 30 days) for flexible attribution analysis.
