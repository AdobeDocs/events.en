# Driving CX Success with Adobe Customer Journey Analytics Journey Canvas

In this session, we’ll explore the powerful capabilities of Adobe Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) and its Journey Canvas to drive deeper, outcome-oriented Customer Experience (CX) strategies. We'll focus on a practical framework for mapping and comparing the "happy path"—your ideal user journey—with actual user behavior, uncovering where friction, drop-off, or divergence from intent occurs.

Attendees will learn how to use journey-level analysis to pinpoint actionable opportunities that streamline user experience, foster desired behaviors, and support business objectives. We’ll also demonstrate how to tie these insights to specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), ensuring CX enhancements are not only intuitive but also measurable.

Finally, we’ll dive into strategies for scaling these insights across the organization by connecting Journey Canvas findings to granular dashboards, enabling continuous optimization at every touchpoint. Whether you're new to CJA or a seasoned practitioner, this session will equip you with a clear methodology for using Journey Canvas to elevate your CX programs and drive tangible results.

## Journey Canvas: From Analysis to Activation

* Build "happy path" and real user journeys to visualize and compare ideal vs. actual experiences.
* Add KPIs and critical data points to monitor journey performance and identify friction points.
* Create segments directly from journey steps and push them to AEP for marketing activation.
* Easily reuse or clone Journey Canvas visuals for different timeframes or redesign comparisons.
* Centralized dashboards ensure all teams work from a single source of truth, streamlining CX optimization.
 
## Merging Data Silos for Unified Analytics

* Use Adobe Analytics connectors to ingest multiple report suites into the Experience Platform without new tagging.
* Map disparate fields (e.g., different eVar numbers) into a unified schema for consistent analysis.
* Query Service enables harmonization and extraction of common fields, creating a single dataset for Customer Journey Analytics (CJA).
* Achieve cross-channel analysis, journey overlap, and unified reporting—enabling insights like "users who visited both site A and site B."
* No need for global tagging or Web SDK reimplementation; the process is post-implementation and scalable.
