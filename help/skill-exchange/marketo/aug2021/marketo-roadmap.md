# Your Marketo Roadmap

Marketo is so customizable and extensible that there’s so much opportunity. But at the same time, poor planning, or the lack of planning, could leave you with a Marketo instance that scales poorly and a bunch of tech debt.

It helps to think of your Marketo instance as a product. You have customers and need to develop your instance into a product that makes your customers happy. But rushing straight at lifecycle marketing or ABM may not end well. So you also have a product roadmap, which is your program of work, guiding you how to get there.
