## Transforming Lead Management with AI Agents

Discover how AI agents revolutionize lead qualification and lifecycle management in Marketo.

* **Holistic Evaluation** AI agents assess leads using demographic, firmographic, and behavioral data for smarter decisions.
* **Agentic Automation** Move beyond static rules—AI agents reason, learn, and act autonomously, improving accuracy and speed.
* **Seamless Integration** Easily connect AI agents to Marketo via smart campaigns, webhooks, or watch lists, enabling real-time actions.
* **Human Oversight** Start with person-in-the-loop workflows for trust and gradual automation.
* **Scalable & Transparent** Agents provide clear explanations for actions, boosting sales alignment and trust.

Harnessing these insights enables more effective, adaptable, and transparent lead management—empowering teams to focus on strategy and growth.

## Building Your AI Agent: Key Components

* **Instructions** Clearly define lead qualification logic and decision steps for the agent.
* **Knowledge** Upload your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), lead categories, and examples for context.
* **Tools** Enable enrichment (e.g., LinkedIn, APIs), Marketo API actions, and smart campaign triggers.
* **Brain (Model)** Choose an AI model (OpenAI, Gemini, Llama) suited for classification, reasoning, and summarization.
* **Setup** No coding required—use platforms like Copilot Studio or Azure AI Foundry to upload documents and configure workflows.
