# Data Drip: Benefits of Migrating from an Old System to Web SDK

Join us for this Data Drip webinar where Adobe Customer Technical Advisor, Arindam Agarwal, will guide us through the systemic benefits of the Adobe Web Software Development Kit. Adobe Web SDK is a client-side solution that leverages its services through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network - creating sustained competitive advantages, lowering operation costs, and improving performance compared to older libraries. Arindam will provide an in-depth overview of Web SDK, its features and advantages such as: - Ease of implementation - Simplified integration - Smarter tracking enablement - Liability reductions - Event side forwarding - Website traffic flows

## Unlocking the Power of Adobe Web SDK

Discover how migrating to Adobe Web SDK transforms digital data collection and personalization. This modern approach streamlines workflows and future-proofs your organization.

* **Unified Data Collection** Replace multiple libraries with a single lightweight SDK, reducing page weight and maintenance.
* **Edge Network Integration** Route all data through Adobe's distributed servers for efficient delivery to analytics, personalization, and third-party platforms.
* **Performance & Compliance** Enjoy faster websites, improved governance, and built-in privacy features like consent management.
* **Simplified Implementation** Migrate with clear planning, schema mapping, and robust debugging tools.

Harnessing these capabilities enables cleaner data, stronger compliance, and scalable digital experiences.

## Unified Data Collection Explained

Adobe Web SDK consolidates multiple tracking libraries (Analytics, Target, Audience Manager) into one unified alloy.js script. This single SDK:

* Sends all data in one call to the edge network, reducing network requests and page load times.
* Handles both data collection and personalization, eliminating the need for separate requests.
* Integrates with Adobe's edge network, which routes data to configured solutions and third-party destinations.
* Supports standardized Experience Data Model (XDM) schemas for consistent data across platforms.

This approach simplifies maintenance, improves performance, and enables seamless collaboration between teams.
