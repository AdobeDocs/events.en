# Espressos & Experience Manager: Edge Delivery Services

Watch our first Espressos & Experience Manager webinar of the year! Our resident AEM experts, Casey Witter and Rajan Kumar, cover everything you need to know about one of AEM's most powerful offerings: Edge Delivery Services (EDS). EDS is a composable set of services that creates a development environment where customers can rapidly update and launch sites while improving conversion rates and reducing costs. During this session, we focus on EDS' latest features and answer customers' most frequently asked questions. We explore Seamless Authoring with the new AEM Universal Editor, which empowers customers with drag-and-drop editing for content, fragments, and pages. Casey and Rajan also walk through how to leverage the SPEED program to quickly enhance your Lighthouse scores, drive more traffic, improve user retention, and increase conversions.
