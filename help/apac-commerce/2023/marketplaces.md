# Dare to grow? Mirakl Marketplaces as a force for growth

In September's installment of the APAC Commerce Webinar Series, we are excited to welcome guest speakers, Cheryl Jones and Joael Pereira, joining us from Mirakl, one of Adobe's Premier Technology Partners. In this session you will learn how to leverage marketplaces to drive incremental revenue while delivering an exceptional customer experience and the importance of adapting to an increasingly demanding consumer market. You'll glean the ease and simplicity of integrating marketplaces into your Adobe Commerce store with a demo, and have the opportunity to ask our speakers questions live.

Join us to discover:

* What's driving the rise of marketplaces
* How marketplaces deliver on customer expectations
* The benefits and potential return on investment
* Examples of retailers who have had success with marketplaces
* The role of AI in personalisation as well as day-to-day operations

More and more businesses are seeing marketplaces as a strategic cornerstone of their business, and those investing are reaping the rewards. Marketplace & drop ship growth was 6x higher than e-commerce alone in 2022 so it's clear that there is an opportunity in this space for those who dare to grow.
