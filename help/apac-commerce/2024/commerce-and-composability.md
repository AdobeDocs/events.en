# Enabling diverse business models with Commerce & Composability

In May’s instalment of the APAC Commerce Webinar Series, we will welcome Sharon Selvaraj, Solution Architect Adobe Customer Solutions, to share how you can enable diverse business models with Adobe Commerce & composable architecture.

Conducting ”business as usual” is no longer an option. Companies that effectively react to this new reality are reaping the benefits. There is a shift towards a more interconnected and customer-centric approach to business, where customer experience, collaboration and partnerships play a central role in delivering value to end consumers.

Companies are leveraging Adobe commerce to deploy multiple business models in the same platform to cater to customers’ buying preferences. Building a scalable composable architecture offered by the platform allows for greater flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions and customer needs.
