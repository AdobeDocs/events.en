# The Next Era of Experimentation: How Agentic AI is Fueling Smarter Testing and Growth

In this Experience League Live session, we unveil **Adobe Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator** — a new AI-first application built to transform how experimentation, product and growth teams test, learn, and optimize campaigns and customer journeys.  

Powered by the **Adobe Experience Platform Experimentation Agent**, this new application automates experimentation analysis while reducing manual effort, so teams can: 

* Discover what works and why with clear, AI-powered insights 
* Identify high-impact opportunities ranked by predicted lift and conversion 
* Accelerate optimization using AI and adaptive experiments on active tests 
* Centralize learnings to align teams and scale experimentation impact and ROI 

Whether you're a growth marketer, product manager, or optimization strategist, see how generative and agentic AI is fueling experimentation with smarter, faster decision-making,  driving measurable growth.  

*Adobe Journey Optimizer Experimentation Accelerator seamlessly integrates with Adobe Target and Journey Optimizer.*
