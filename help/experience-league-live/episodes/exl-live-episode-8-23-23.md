While Adobe Journey Optimizer provides a modern, marketer friendly interface and workflow to create and manage personalized, real-time 1:1 customer journeys, businesses also need to communicate time-sensitive, and mission critical messages based on urgent signals and author messages to audiences without creating journeys. These messages could include password resets, one-time codes, or even post-game updates to subscriber base of sports fans.

With API Triggered Campaigns, businesses can set a campaign and use it multiple times to deliver personalized messages with real time contextual information by triggering via REST API.   

In this Experience League Live Session, Adobe product experts will explain how you can execute transactional and marketing use cases with API Triggered Messaging capabilities in AJO.
