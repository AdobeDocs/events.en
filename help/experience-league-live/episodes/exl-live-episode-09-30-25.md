# Expand your mobile reach with RCS and WhatsApp in Journey Optimizer

Travis Jordan andn Nikhil Sharma showed how Adobe Journey Optimizer has recently expanded mobile engagement with powerful new channel additions and functionality, including WhatsApp, RCS, and Custom SMS Provider.

They walked through the advantages and differences between RCS and WhatsApp, went through how to set-up these new channels, including API credentials and webhooks, and showed how you can incorporate these channels into your existing omni-channel engagement strategy.
