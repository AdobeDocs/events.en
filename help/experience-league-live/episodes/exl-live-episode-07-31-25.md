# Fueling Personalized Content in Journey Optimizer with AEM Content Fragments and Dynamic Media

In this session, Jyothitha Chandran, Chris Ivory, and Kaitlin White showcased how Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) integrates seamlessly with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Sites Content Fragments and AEM Assets Dynamic Media to deliver scalable, real-time personalization across every channel.   

Discover how you can now reuse AEM Content Fragments directly within AJO to streamline content delivery, eliminate duplication, and ensure consistency across email, web, push, and more. Learn how Dynamic Media integration empowers marketers to create hyper-personalized visuals—like custom images with real-time text overlays—using centralized assets that update instantly across campaigns.   

Whether you're part of a lean team or a large enterprise, this session will show how to accelerate content velocity, maintain brand integrity, and personalize at scale—without reinventing your workflow.
