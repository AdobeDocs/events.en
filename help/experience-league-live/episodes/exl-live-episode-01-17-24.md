# Bringing your Adobe Analytics data and analyses into Customer Journey Analytics

Join Bryan, Eric, and Doug as they discuss how to quickly get moving with Customer Journey Analytics (CJA). You'll learn about using automated processes to move data and analyses from Adobe Analytics to CJA, as well as any gotchas to consider during the process. And of course, they'll have a healthy dose of fun tips and tricks along the way.

## Key takeaways

* There are two ways to get data from Adobe Analytics into Customer Journey Analytics: the Analytics Data Connector (ADC) and the Web SDK.
* The ADC allows data from a report suite to be copied into Adobe Experience Platform for analysis, while the Web SDK sends data directly into Adobe Experience Platform.
* Data views in Customer Journey Analytics provide a way to customize and analyze the data that is brought into the platform.
* Data views offer powerful features such as retroactive changes, derived fields for customization, and the ability to filter and analyze data at a granular level.
* Connections in Customer Journey Analytics allow for the union of different data sets, enabling the analysis of multiple data sources in one place.
* Data views and connections should be used strategically and with caution to ensure proper governance and control over data access and analysis.
* There is a new tool called "component migration" that allows Adobe Analytics admins to migrate projects to CGA.
* When migrating a project, all components in the tables, as well as any segments or calculated metrics applied, get moved over to CGA.
* There is a mapping process where components that don't exist in CGA can be mapped using catch-all or derived fields.
* It is recommended to create a catch-all for elements that don't exist in CGA and then edit them in the destination project.
* Previously, it was believed that calculated metrics and segments had to be recreated when migrating to CGA, but now there is an option to migrate them.
* To ensure that calculated metrics and segments are included in the migration, they need to be applied to a table or visualization in Adobe Analytics.
