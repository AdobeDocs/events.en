The use case playbooks were built to address two major challenges,

1. **Blank page syndrome** - Many customers, especially new ones, feel overwhelmed when they first get access to the Adobe Experience platform and don't know where to start or how to leverage its power. The use case playbooks help customers overcome this initial hurdle by providing curated sets of use case templates that guide them through the process of implementing specific marketing goals.

1. **Greater adoption and engagement** - The playbooks aim to help customers get up to speed faster and make the most of their investment in Adobe products by providing pre-built templates and technical guidance.  This helps customers implement use cases more quickly, demonstrate value to stakeholders, and foster collaboration between IT and marketing teams.  Ultimately, the playbooks aim to maximize the adoption and value customers get from the Adobe Experience platform.

An example of a use case discussed in this session is an abandoned browsing and merchandise use case. This use case aims to address the challenge of customers abandoning their browsing session before making a purchase. The resulting audience segment for this use case would be customers who have abandoned their browsing session without completing a purchase. This segment can then be targeted with personalized messages or offers to encourage them to return and complete their purchase.
