# Introducing all new Reference Demos in AEM

Learn the fastest way to provision, demo, and explore features of AEM as a Cloud Service

The AEM Reference Demos Add-On allows for the easy creation of sandbox environments pre-loaded with sample content and pre-configured using the latest Adobe best practices guidelines. With the add-on, you can easily evaluate AEM features in context and with hardly any configuration. Demos include Sites, SPA Editor, Commerce and advanced features of Assets.

Join us for a live presentation and demo with Adobe Product Manager Hyman Chung and headwire CTO Ruben Reusser.
