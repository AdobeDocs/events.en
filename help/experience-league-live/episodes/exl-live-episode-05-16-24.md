**Details**: In this session, learn the latest and greatest (NEW) way to migrate Adobe Analytics to the Web SDK. This will allow you to use the new, faster libraries, lots of new features, and future-proof your implementation as you look toward using Adobe Experience Platform, all while easily sending data to Adobe Analytics (and Target and AAM).

We'll configure a data stream on the edge, and install and configure the Web SDK extension in our Tags property. We'll show how to migrate different rule types from the Analytics extension to the Web SDK.

Don't miss this chance to ask questions in the chat during this livestream event and get answers from the experts.
