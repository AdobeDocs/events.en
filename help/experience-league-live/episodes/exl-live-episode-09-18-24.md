You have been using Adobe Analytics in your mobile app to gain insights into your digital business and understand how your customers use your app.

You've also heard that Edge Data Collection is the future of the Adobe ecosystem, enabling you to leverage other solutions such as Real-Time CDP, Journey Optimizer, and Customer Journey Analytics.

Is it possible to upgrade your app to retain the existing implementation for Analytics and migrate to Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) at your own pace?

In this session, you will learn how to use the Edge Bridge extension to bridge the gap for migration. We will provide step-by-step instructions on how to configure your mobile properties and update your client-side implementation to use Edge Bridge.

After the migration, you can still access your data in Analytics, bringing you one step closer to AEP. Still unsure? We will show you how to validate your implementation and debug in real-time.
