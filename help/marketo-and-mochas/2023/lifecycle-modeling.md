# Customer Journey Management: Lifecycle Modeling

Transparency has recently become one of the most valuable attributes of a successful marketing strategy. During this session we tackle all of the crucial questions to building credibility and knowing when and which levers to pull. Adobe's own Marketing Automation Business Advisor, Cynthia Chang and Marketo Customer Technical Advisor, James Leedom help you get ahead of these questions:

* What stage of the buying journey is the lead currently at?
* What is our conversion rate from stage to stage in the funnel?
* How quickly are leads moving through the customer journey?
* How many MQLs do we need in order to get X dollars in pipeline?

They share strategies for setting up your lifecycle correctly from the start, and properly segmenting people in the buying journey. Cynthia and James also run through an in-product demonstration of the lifecycle modeler and share some of the various reporting and analytics available to help analyze the effectiveness of your customer segments.
