# Marketo Measure & Mochas: Activities and Custom Models

In this webinar, Adobe Business Advisor, Kate Colbert, and Customer Technical Advisor, James Leedom, share strategies for leveraging Custom Attribution Models and Activities Attribution to maximize the value Adobe Marketo Measure brings your business. Beyond its 5 standard attribution models, Marketo Measure also offers Custom Attribution Models that enable users to adjust attribution weighting for up to six additional milestone stages. This allows Marketo Measure to highlight more Touchpoint Positions specific to the stages you are looking to draw insights from. Likewise, the Activities Attribution feature empowers users to create touchpoints directly from the Activity records in their CRM and assign attribution credit to Tasks or Events. This makes it possible to align your Sales and Marketing data into one unified story. Kate and James demonstrate real-life examples of how to use these tools including how to set rules and filters in Marketo Measure to capture precisely the engagements you want to report on. As always, we conclude with a live Q&A session to address customer questions.
