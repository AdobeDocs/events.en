# Establishing a Workfront center of excellence

What exactly is a Center of Excellence and why should you create one for Workfront?  

In this on-demand webinar, Neal Gardner, Manager, Marketing Asset Management Operations at Mattel, and Samantha Bagley, Principal Customer Success Manager at Adobe Workfront, will walk through the components of a Workfront Center of Excellence (CoE).  

Together they'll share their experience in how investing the time up-front to establish a CoE will make ongoing administration of Workfront easier, not to mention more sustainable and scalable in the long run. It's also not as hard as you might think! They will cover:  

* Components of a successful Center of Excellence
* The "enablers" you can look for along the way
* How to start and find incremental success along the way
* How establishing a CoE at Mattel resulted in a significant improvement of end user adoption, Group Admin engagement, breadth of product usage and data integrity
