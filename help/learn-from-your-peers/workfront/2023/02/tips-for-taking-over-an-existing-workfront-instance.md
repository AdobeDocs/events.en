# Tips for taking over an existing Workfront instance

At some point you may find yourself taking over an instance of Workfront you didn't initially set up. Would you know where to start? How would you uncover why things were implemented the way they were? Where would you find documentation and answers?  

In this on-demand webinar, Jace Newbold, Manager of Consulting at Workfront (and a former customer), will be joined by Brandon Hamm, Head of Marketing Process and Platforms at Walgreens, and Ryan Kirk, System Admin at RLI Insurance Company, who will each share their experience in taking over a Workfront instance they didn't have a hand in implementing. Together they'll cover:

* Their individual experience, including lessons learned
* What every Admin should do today to set their future selves (and future Admins) up for success
* A downloadable checklist with questions, resources, and links to guide you through the process of auditing and documenting your instance
