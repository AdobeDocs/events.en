# Foundations of project templates

Project templates allow you to create specific, repeatable processes so you can avoid "reinventing the wheel," but does everything need to be a template? How many templates is too many? And what's the best way to update them?  

In this on-demand webinar, Kiersten Kollins, Sr. Marketing Operations Technologist and System Admin at DSW, and Jen Desmond, Customer Success Architect at Adobe Workfront (and former customer), will walk through:  
 
* Why templates are important
* Template development best practices
* Common template pitfalls to avoid (don't forget task constraints!)
* What Kiersten and Jen wish they had known when they were first implementing project templates
