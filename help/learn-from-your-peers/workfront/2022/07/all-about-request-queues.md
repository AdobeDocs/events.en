# All about request queues

There's more to Request Queues than requesting work 

You might be familiar with Adobe Workfront Request Queues as a way to request work of a team or a department, but they can be so much more! 

Request Queues allow you to have one centralized location to submit requests, whether that request IS for new work, or for something like PTO approval, hardware or software requests, new business card orders, data exports, reporting bugs, just to name a few simple ideas. 

In this on-demand webinar, two System Admins from Disney's Yellow Shoes, the internal ad agency for Walt Disney Parks & Resorts, will share their experience and evolution with request queues. They'll cover:

* The anatomy of a request queue
* An introduction to "Issues"
* Queue setup and queue topics
* A few "Did You Know" quick tips
* How Disney's Yellow Shoes' request queues have evolved over time
* And more!
