# Navigating change management

Change is inevitable, but rarely easy. Any change – personal or professional – can lead to feelings of stress, excitement, anxiety, and more. We can't help it! It's how our brains are wired. BUT... it is possible to become comfortable with change.

In this on-demand webinar, Leigh Burger, change management guru and Principal Customer Success Manager with Adobe Workfront, will be joined by Julie Simon, Director, Marketing Project Portfolio Management, and Lexi McGraw, Project Portfolio Manager, from Penn State University. They are each uniquely passionate about creating positive and meaningful change, and together they'll cover:

* The anatomy of change
* How our brains perceive change (and WHY)
* How Penn State took a human and empathetic approach to change when implementing Workfront
* Example communication and collaboration ideas, and more
