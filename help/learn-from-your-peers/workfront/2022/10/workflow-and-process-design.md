# Workflow and process design webinar

As your experience with Workfront grows, the processes that you and your team (and OTHER teams) will want to manage in Workfront will also undoubtedly grow. Before you start building, we recommend you document and design your new process outside of Workfront first. Why would you do that? And what does it look like?  

In this on-demand webinar, Didi Dunn, Principal Consultant with Adobe Workfront, and two Workfront experts from T-Mobile, will cover:

* The critical elements to consider before creating a workflow in Workfront
* A list of recommended questions you can ask to fully understand the processes requirements 
* Tips for putting together the ideal working group to influence and champion this new process 
* First-hand experience and lessons learned from T-Mobile on how they manage numerous strategic implementations each year
