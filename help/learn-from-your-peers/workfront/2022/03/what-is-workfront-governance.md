# What IS Workfront Governance?

Governance might sound like a "leadership problem," but it's a key concept every Workfront System Administrator must address. The good news is, you can start small, maybe with just a glossary of terms or a small working group, and evolve your practices over time.

In this on-demand Webinar, Tyler Holt, a Consultant in Workfront's Success Services organization, and Luke Ramlow, Application Analyst at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, will cover:
* What governance in Workfront actually means
* Examples of different types of governance
* Ways governance can evolve and mature over time
* Mayo Clinic College of Medicine's multi-year journey to full scale governance (spoiler alert, it didn't happen overnight!)
