# Leveraging the group admin

Group Administrator vs. System Administrator. Who owns what?  

In the last few years, Adobe Workfront has added a LOT of flexibility to how preferences can be set globally and then optimized at the group level for each department's unique needs. This has introduced a change in thinking about the role of the System Administrator and the Group Administrator. It has also introduced some questions!   

In this on-demand webinar, we'll be reviewing the evolving role of the Workfront Group Administrator, including:

* How to determine when it's time to add group administration 
* Common roles and responsibilities 
* Best practices for defining standard practices across groups 
* Examples of what to document and how to communicate changes 
* How Group Admins can be an advocate and champion for their teams 
* And more! 

If you have Group Admins, we strongly encourage you to share this webinar with them.
