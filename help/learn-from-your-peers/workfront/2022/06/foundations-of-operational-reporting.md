# Learn From Your Peers Webinar: Foundations of Operational Reporting

There are MANY things you can report on in Workfront, but do you know what you, as a System Administrator, should be measuring?   

Reports can be a powerful work management tool in and of themselves. Not only can they offer visibility into the work being done, but they can also improve productivity and help identify problems before they happen. 

In this on-demand webinar on the topic of operational reporting, we'll cover:

* What you need to identify BEFORE you start building reports
* Examples of common operational metrics
* Persona types and how their reporting needs differ
* Sample dashboards that show different ways information can be presented and sorted
* And more!
