## Summary

This Learn from Your Peers sessions discussed the setup and management of engagement programs in Marketo. It covered topics such as planning, building, and reporting within engagement programs. Key points included choosing between trip nurture and engagement programs, using smart campaigns for transitions, deciding between emails and default programs, and understanding program success metrics. ​ The discussion also touched on topics like transitioning content, managing different languages, utilizing dynamic content, and setting up multiple streams based on lifecycle stages or product families.
