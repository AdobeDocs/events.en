# Person Scoring Mastery with Marketo Engage: Localized Nuances in a Global Framework

As an administrator, you develop the Marketo Engage person scoring model based on the real business value of the scoring elements compared to each other. But what if that business value varies in different markets? How do you allow for local influences without losing consistency across your organization?

Learn how Marketo Engage Champion, Katja Keesom, finds this tricky balance by building local flexibility into the scoring model.

In this webinar, you'll learn:

* Why local flexibility is important but cannot turn into the Wild West of person scoring without control
* How to set up a transparent and scalable person scoring model
* The best way to implement this in Marketo Engage, allowing for local market flexibility while keeping the model -logical and consistent.
