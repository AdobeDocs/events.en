## Overview

The training session primarily focused on the migration of Marketo Engage to Adobe Identity using the Adobe Admin console. It covered essential aspects like user migration, roles, permissions, workspace management, and support transition. The session detailed the migration process, including subscription migration, user verification, system admin roles, and user management in the new console. Emphasis was placed on email verification, user access management, and the roles of different admins involved in the migration. Common queries about deactivated users, workspace setup, and support on the Marketo Engage community during the migration were also addressed.
