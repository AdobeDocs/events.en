Just getting started with Resource Pools? First things first, what are they?

* A Resource Pool is a collection of users that are needed at the same time for the completion of a project.
* A Resource Pool can be shared across multiple projects, programs, or portfolios when it is associated with all the projects in the programs and portfolios.
* After you populate your Resource Pools with users, you can associate them with projects and templates, and you can associate as many Resource Pools as needed with a project, template, or user.
