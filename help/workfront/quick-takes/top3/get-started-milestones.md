# Top 3 - How to get started with Milestones

Let's talk about Milestone Paths! It's your "On-Demand Workfront CSM" Cynthia Boon, and I thought I'd share my love of Milestone Reports, and how easy it is to get started.

This is a great report for your higher-level leadership and even your requesters, looking for project statuses, but who might not need to see the full details of projects.

Including a Milestone Report on your Project Dashboard or sharing this report (even better, automatically scheduling it for regular delivery) is a great way to keep interested parties - even non-Workfront users - engaged with the progress of projects.
