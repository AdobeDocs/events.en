# Creative Ways of Managing Resources in Adobe Workfront 

This workshop was recorded on May 20, 2025 and featured Rick Christensen from Western Governors University and Kiersten Kollins and Nicole Alanis from DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse as they shared how they are capturing and reporting on capacity in Workfront.
By using innovative approaches and practical solutions, they were able to think outside the box and pull together core functionalities like Home Teams, charts, project templates, and custom fields to proactively understand and track user or team capacity.
