# Top 3 – Creative Approaches with Blueprints

Hey everybody! It's me, your "On-Demand Workfront CSM" and I'm back with another Top 3 Video!  This time let's talk about [Blueprints](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview). You've probably heard me say that Blueprints are the shortcut to your "Workfront work" but what are the other ways to use Blueprints to fast track your enterprise needs?

If you want to experiment first before you install anything in Production, no worries!  Just play around with them in your [Sandbox Preview environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/set-up-wf/testing-environments/wf-preview-sandbox-environment) first.
