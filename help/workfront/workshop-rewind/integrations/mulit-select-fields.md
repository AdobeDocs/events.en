* An event hosted in partnership with the Adobe Software Development Team was delivered in early May on the changes to Event Subscriptions if you want to learn more on that specific area, [[Event Follow-Up] Preserving Your Fusion Scenarios During the Event Subscriptions V2 Upgrade](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront-discussions/event-follow-up-preserving-your-fusion-scenarios-during-the/m-p/754182#M4041)

## Key Takeaways and Resources

* Changes to the Workfront API multi-select fields are coming in version 21 (October 2025) to ensure consistent JSON array format instead of mixed string/array responses
* Event subscription versioning is being introduced - version 2 will always return multi-select fields as arrays, while version 1 maintains current inconsistent behavior
* New event subscriptions automatically default to version 2, and all subscriptions will be automatically upgraded to version 2 in mid-January 2026
* A new Workfront connector version will be released later this year with manual upgrade process to preserve module mapping and prevent breaking changes
* Fusion AI assistant is currently available but requires a signed AI agreement and proper licensing setup. Please reach out to your Account Manager if you have questions or are interested in learning more. [More information on using AI within Fusion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront-fusion/using/manage-scenarios/fusion-ai-assistant)
