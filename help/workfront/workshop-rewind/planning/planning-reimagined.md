# Workfront Planning, Reimagined: SNHU's Creative Use Cases

Join Heather MacDonald, Associate Vice President, Marketing Operations, Southern New Hampshire University as she shares how her SNHU team navigated out-of-the-box (OOTB) challenges and used Workfront Planning features in creative, unexpected ways to drive visibility, alignment, and better decision-making in Marketing Operations. From unique portfolio setups to inventive timeline strategies, she offered real-life examples and practical tips you can apply in your own environment.
