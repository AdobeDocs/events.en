# Start Fast, Scale Smart: Activating Team-Level Success with Workfront Planning

This workshop was recorded on May 28, 2025 and featured our Adobe Workfront Product team where they shared their expertise for implementing Workfront Planning. 

If you’re just getting started with Workfront Planning, consider a team-first approach rather than enterprise-wide implementation to help with adoption efforts: 

* **Federal vs State Model** Set up a governance strategy where teams (states) adopt Workfront Planning autonomously within guided parameters, rather than waiting for complete enterprise-wide (federal) implementation  
* **Key Benefits of Team-First Approach** Faster adoption, reduced resistance, built-in evangelists, lower support burden for admins, and real-world feedback to inform enterprise-scale design decisions
