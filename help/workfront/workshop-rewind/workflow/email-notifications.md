And here's a quick summary of the tips that were shared in the chat: 

* Uncheck the box for "Send emails from Workfront when a comment is made on a proof" via Setup > Email > Review and Approval to avoid duplicate notifications. 
* Over communicate initially so as not to miss notifications then instruct users to use the email footer option to turn off what they don't want to receive. 
* Ask your users what’s working well and what isn’t. They may not say it directly, but you can listen to their complaints or questions in meetings and adjust notifications to address those issues.  
* If email or in-app notifications aren’t working, try something different – look to build a dashboard with a series of reports or utilize automatic report deliveries to get the information out there.  
* If users aren’t receiving (email) notifications, you always have the option of logging in as them to confirm the notification is turned on in their profile. Reach out to Customer Support as well if you get stuck!   
* Consider turning off the emails associated with statuses changes – are these causing more noise than informative action?
