# Workfront Crowdsource Challenge: Project Templates

This workshop was recorded on April 8, 2025 and featured Ross Barton and Lindsay Love from Ologie who shared their Workfront story, reaching out for feedback from the customer community.  As Workfronters, we are always looking for opportunities to see how other customers configure their system and manage their processes, so this was an amazing opportunity.

Along with the on-demand recording, we’ve included the slide deck and tips that were shared in the chat:

## Tips

* Use Programs and break the phases & deliverables into separate smaller projects. Use a separate Custom Form “Campaign” field to break the Projects down further, but available for Groupings in Reports. 
* Use Task Descriptions to put more information in the Description, allowing you to cut down on some Tasks.  (Make sure your users are using a View with the Description field as a column.) 
* Use Bolt-on or Add-on Templates to keep the initial Project Template small, allowing for flexibility if the scope increases. 
* Only create different Tasks when there is a hand-off or for Tasks that are essential for Reporting. 
* Limit “Project Setup” efforts to one Task and include information in the Description or in Custom Forms as needed. 
* Use Custom Form with logic so that when you are building the project you need to do for the client – all the questions you need to ask, all the steps you need to take are in the custom form details for the “do-ers” to do. Keep the template simple. 
* Use Views with Custom Form Data so that “what needs to get done” could be in Custom Form fields instead of Tasks that need to be marked complete. 

One of the biggest themes we saw in the chat was the challenge of trying to keep Project Templates simple, but at the same time tracking the effort and ensuring that teams are delivering on all the steps needed to complete the project.  

 We hope to see you at future Customer Success workshops!  Be sure to check out the [Workfront Events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/events/?filters=Workfront) on Experience League for the full list and to register.
