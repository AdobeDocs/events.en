# Fast and Functional: Blueprints in Adobe Workfront

The [Blueprints library](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/blueprints/list-of-available-blueprints) in Adobe Workfront is constantly growing with new, ready-to-use templates and dashboards. With a quick install process, you can spend less time setting up and more time getting work done.  

The Workfront Customer Success team shared everything you need to know about [Blueprints](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/blueprints/blueprints-overview) - what they are, how they work, and how you can start using them today to maximize value across your organization.
