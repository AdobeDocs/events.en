# From Self-Taught to Success: How Kyndryl Scaled Workfront to Power $7B

Hosted in partnership with Rachel Small and Bill McCandless of Kyndryl, this session provided an overview of how Kyndryl's in-house creative team took a self-taught approach to building a Workfront model that could support a $7B global business. They designed and scaled a content operations framework using native Workfront features like project templates, custom forms, reports and dashboards to balance speed, visibility, and governance.

Taking what they learned from other Workfront customers, this is a great story of how powerful (and generous) the Workfront Community is.
