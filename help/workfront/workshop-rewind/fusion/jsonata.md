# Making JSON sing with Workfront Fusion + JSONata

Hosted in partnership with Steve Watts and Brian Haight of Adobe Professional Services, this session walked through the basics of reading JSON path notation, understanding data types, and choosing the right starting path in Fusion. 

In addition, three real-world examples were covered from finding and filtering data, to reshaping JSON, and doing advanced transformations on the fly. It's a must-have skill for any Fusion admin looking to save time and simplify data handling!
