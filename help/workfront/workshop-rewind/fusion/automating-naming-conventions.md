# 5 Tips for Automating Naming Conventions Using Workfront Fusion

Keeping your Workfront environment organized starts with consistent naming conventions but enforcing them manually can be time-consuming and error prone. In this webinar hosted in partnership with Adobe Professional Services and Field Engineering, learn how to leverage Workfront Fusion to automatically apply naming standards across projects, tasks, issues, and more.

We'll walk through real-world examples on how to use Fusion to:

- Dynamically generate project names based on form inputs or metadata 
- Standardize task and issue names for easy reporting and visibility 
- Utilize incrementing numbers to label objects and ensure uniqueness across your instance 
 
Whether you're just getting started with Fusion or looking to expand your automations, you'll walk away with practical examples and inspiration to streamline your Workfront setup.
