## Tips

 * Start small. Communication is the key to change! 
 * Have your “Why are we using Workfront – elevator speech” ready! Your Execs and your users will ask, so having clear talking points will prepare you for those surprise conversations. 
 * Use Workfront to support and track your Governance and Center of Excellence efforts.
