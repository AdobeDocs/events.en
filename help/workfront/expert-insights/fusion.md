## Need your help!

As Ewan mentioned in the video, he is working on a Fusion Best Practice guide, and he would love to hear from you!  If you are using Fusion to support your processes, please share your advice, recommendations, and tips in the [Experience League Community Post](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront-discussions/video-february-2024-workfront-expert-insights-fusion-with-ewan/td-p/657114), and he will try to include as many as possible!

## Advice

* Fusion is visual representation of your processes. Documentation is your friend! Speaking of documentation, save the details of how you build your processes.  Even better, video yourself walking through them! 
* Measure the effort and hours of your repetitive work
* The Adobe Workfront ROI Calculator that Ewan mentioned is attached to the [Experience League Community Post](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/workfront-discussions/video-february-2024-workfront-expert-insights-fusion-with-ewan/td-p/657114).
