# Workfront Expert Insights: Text Mode with Katherine Lanning

Welcome to the latest Expert Insights!  I'm Cynthia Boon, your "On-Demand" Workfront CSM and for this episode we have Workfront Text Mode Jedi, Katherine Lanning, Workfront Solutions Engineer from IQVIQ!  During this episode, Katherine shares her story, her passion for all things Text Mode Reporting, and demos how she built her "Sanity Management" Dashboard!

Text Mode can be challenging, but the rewards are amazing.  Just remember Katherine's advice!

* "If you can see it, you can change it." - Flip into text mode on standard reports to see how columns are built.
* Learn by tinkering. - Add fields, switch to text mode, and experiment to understand what drives the data.
* Use plain language. - Title columns as questions or clear statements so non-admins can interpret them easily.
* Add descriptions. - Customize hover text in text mode to explain data and guide users.
* Make visuals accessible. - Don't rely only on colors (e.g., red/green). Use distinct icons or labels.
* Leverage the community. - Rely on Experience League, cookbooks, API Explorer, and peers. Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Persist, but take breaks. - If stuck, close the laptop, take a walk, and return with fresh eyes.

## About the speaker

Katherine is the Workfront Solutions Engineer and Fusion developer for IQVIA Digital. When asked what she does for a living, she responds 'I'm someone' – as in 'Someone really should be able to figure out a better way to do that.' Her background spans corporate finance, IT, and systems administration in industries adult beverages, marketing and advertising and even private security. 

She lives in southwestern Ohio with her accidental husband, their dog 'Bettis', two motorcycles and enough hobbies for three people. Ideal weekends include blacksmithing conferences, exploring Arashiyama, quality time with the Xbox or baking new cheesecake recipes.

(And yes, all of these things are completely true. She's not the one to play that icebreaker 'Two truths and a lie' game with.)
