# Expert Insights - Adoption with Leslie Spier

Adoption is a topic that we return to regularly, and in this edition of our Expert Insights interview, Leslie Spier shares her experience and ideas for building engagement within your organization.

Join me, your On-Demand Workfront CSM, as I chat with Leslie about why Adoption is such an important topic, along with some of our favorite strategies.

## Tips, Advice, and more

* Watch me work – you can watch your users work in the system to see their challenges, but also to test your assumptions for processes. 
* You can also film yourself working in the system to share out with your users so that they can see what’s possible.

* Leveraging New Hires as your “keepers of Workfront processes” 
  * New hires are fresh in the organization and are ready to adoption the system and processes 

* Feedback meetings and office hours 
  * Remember what Leslie said about how users might approach using the system.  They don’t know all the cool things Workfront can do, so sometimes demoing a feature can build excitement 

* Use scheduled releases to build excitement for new features (and take credit)! 
  * New feature releases can provide Sys Admins with a new narrative and potentially solve challenges.  If you’re communicating the change, then you get to take the credit! 

* Speaking of recognition, don’t forget to use the power of Workfront to recognize your users! 
  * When they offer their ideas, attention, or even complaints, they are offering their gift of time and feedback. These are your unsung heroes, and no contribution is too small!
