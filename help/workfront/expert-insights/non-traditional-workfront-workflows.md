# Expert Insights: Non-Traditional Workfront Workflows with Kiersten Kollins

Welcome to another Expert Insights episode!  I’m Cynthia Boon, your “On-Demand” Workfront CSM. Ever wonder how other customers use Workfront? Looking for unique ways to solve your organizational challenges and support your processes?  

We were lucky enough to have Kiersten Kollins, Senior Marketing Ops Technologist at DSW, join our Retail Industry Circle event in May, where she shared their non-traditional Workfront workflows to manage their team’s work.  

You’ll be amazed at all the fantastic ideas she shares, including: 

 * Bypassing the traditional request queue and issue approach, and leverage project templates to quickly spin up work. 
 * Creating custom reporting to track the “peaks and valleys” of their campaigns for capacity planning. 
 * Customizing their terminology to ensure that the system reflects the culture of the organization. 
 * Initiating Creative Brief reviews to match the needs of their users and projects. 
 * *BONUS!* She also shares an example of one of her favorite Fusion use cases!
