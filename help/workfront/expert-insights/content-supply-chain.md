# Expert Insights – Content Supply Chain with Corre Kombol

Welcome back to Expert Insights!  I’m Cynthia Boon, your “On-Demand” Workfront Customer Success Manager (CSM), and in this episode, we are joined by Corre Kombol, a Principal Customer Success Manager here at Adobe!  

Corre is a truly strategic CSM who sets the pace for us on how to use Adobe Solutions to support your organization's Content Supply Chain efforts. 

## Corre’s Advice

 * Better Exists! 
 * Start by identifying your process paint points and go from there. Don’t let the technology overwhelm the objective.
 * Connect with other customers that are on a similar journey in the Community or at Events!
