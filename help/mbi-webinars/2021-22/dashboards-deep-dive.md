# Commerce Intelligence Dashboards Deep Dive

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Commerce Intelligence was previously known as [!DNL Magento Business Intelligence (MBI)]. Recordings for past events reflect the previous name.

Take a guided tour of the four dashboards included at setup with every Commerce Intelligence account. This recorded webinar highlights the role that your default dashboards play in getting value from your eCommerce store data, and covers the high-level goals of each dashboard. It also dives in to some common use cases of the pre-built reports, such as:

- Identify the impact of customer acquisition campaigns by visualizing the relationships between customer acquisition month and lifetime value.
- Spot trends in hourly orders placement that indicate inventory or staffing allocation needs.
- Determine your most successful products by sales volume and by GMV, and which products account for the most refunds.
