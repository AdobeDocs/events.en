## New reporting and export capabilities

The new reporting and export capabilities in Adobe Acrobat Sign allow users to build, save, and manage their own custom reports and data exports in a personalized view. Reports are templates that return one or more graphs with a summary of the agreement data as defined by the user. The number and type of reports available to the user are dictated by their authority level in the system and the permission scope applied to their user IDs. Users can also extract specific field data from agreements with their authority scope and apply filters to focus the return data set by user, group, workflow, or agreement name. The extracted data can be exported into a CSV file, allowing users to declutter the export from any transactional data they don't need. These new capabilities provide users with more control and flexibility in accessing and analyzing data in Adobe Acrobat Sign.
