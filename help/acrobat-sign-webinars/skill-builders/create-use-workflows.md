# Creating and Using Workflows from Beginning to End

Calling all Acrobat Sign administrators and end users/individual contributors. This session will cover both the creation of and use of workflows. As an Acrobat Sign group or account admin, learn how you can define pre-set workflows to automatically route documents for signature to the correct parties – then grant access to your entire Acrobat Sign group. And as an end user, learn how to use these workflows to ensure documents are signed right the first time — and every time.

## Topics covered

The topics covered in the session are,

* Creating and updating workflows
* Recent changes to workflow functionality
* User experience for initiating workflows
* Admin settings for configuring workflows
* Filtering workflows in the new advanced reporting
* New features added to workflow

## Recent updates to the workflow designer

* The updates that have been recently made to the workflow designer in Adobe Acrobat Sign include:
* Users in multiple group awareness: Group level administrators can create workflows for any group they are a member of, not st their primary group.
* Workflow scope control interface: The interface for defining which users can access the workflow has been updated, with anges to text labels and the use of a single select dropdown menu for selecting individual groups.
* Updated text labels: The text labels for options such as including all group users in the account have been changed to prove clarity.
* Template-defined signature placement: This feature allows for the construction of one fully enabled form with all possible recipient fields defined, and the recipient signer index as defined in the workflow designer is strongly enforced, disregarding any fields assigned to omitted optional recipients when the agreement is sent.
