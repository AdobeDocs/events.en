## Key points

* **Company Hierarchy Feature** Released in the B2B 1.5 update at the end of October, it allows merchants to nest child companies within a parent company for finer control over customer interactions.

* **Website Performance Metrics** Besides sales, companies should focus on conversion rate, average session duration, and bounce rate to evaluate website performance.

* **Adobe Commerce Product Focus** Efforts are concentrated on enhancing platform flexibility, B2B capabilities, and reducing total cost of ownership through tools like App Builder.

* **Live Search Best Practices** Emphasize tracking zero search results, setting up specific search term rules, and ensuring product attributes are searchable.

* **Data Export** Adobe Commerce allows exporting various data types, including product catalogs, customer information, and reports, to spreadsheets.

* **Pros and Cons for Medium to Large Organizations** The platform's extensibility is both a strength and a potential challenge, offering flexibility but requiring careful management to avoid over-engineering.

* **B2B Personalization Techniques** Utilize shared catalogs, personalized pricing, and tailored payment methods to enhance the customer experience.

* **Upcoming 2.4.8 Release** Teased enhancements to core functionalities and product types, with more details expected at Adobe Summit.
