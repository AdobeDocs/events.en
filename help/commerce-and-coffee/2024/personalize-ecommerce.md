description: At this session of Commerce & Coffee, Sr. Commerce Strategy Consultant, Corey Gelato, takes us through the AI features available to further personalize eCommerce experiences. We go over how Adobe Commerce's AI algorithms analyze customer behavior, create segments based on their preferences, and use this data to suggest tailored products via Product Recommendations. Corey also highlights how AI can help craft targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with individual customers through personalized product descriptions, emails, and website banners. As important as it is to analyze past data, predicting future customer behavior can be just as impactful.
