# Migrate Adobe Analytics to AEP Web SDK

In this session, we will walk through the process of migrating your Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target implementations from appmeasurement.js and at.js to the AEP Web SDK (alloy.js). This session is specifically focused on the implementation shift, not on migrating to schema structures for Real-Time CDP (RTCDP) or Customer Journey Analytics (CJA).

Participants will gain a clear understanding of the value of adopting the modern AEP Web SDK, including enhanced performance, streamlined architecture, and greater control over data collection and delivery. As the future forward approach in an evolving digital landscape, the Web SDK simplifies deployments while enabling scalable, efficient, and privacy conscious integrations across Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

By the end of the session, attendees will be equipped with practical guidance and resources to confidently begin or accelerate their migration journey.
