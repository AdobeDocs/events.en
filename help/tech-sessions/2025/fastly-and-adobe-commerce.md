# Tech Sessions: Fastly and Adobe Commerce

In this session, we explore best practices for delivering scalable, high-performing, and resilient digital experiences, while strategically engaging Adobe Support for optimal outcomes.

Learn how to navigate support interactions efficiently, understand the boundaries of Adobe's support scope, and address common “edge of scope” scenarios. The session introduces practical self-enablement strategies that empower teams to troubleshoot and resolve issues independently.

We  provide actionable insights into investigating suspicious activity, identifying potential security concerns, and applying mitigation tactics when needed. Additionally, participants are guided through key documentation and support resources to stay proactive, informed, and confident in maintaining platform health.

Whether you’re a support lead, developer, or platform owner, this session equips you with the tools and knowledge to boost performance, enhance security, and partner effectively with support.

## Key points

* **Importance of Caching for Website Performance** David emphasized the critical role of caching in improving website performance, reducing server load, and enhancing user satisfaction. He provided examples of caching strategies, such as caching static pages, catalog items, and CMS pages, to minimize overhead and improve speed.

* **Common Complications with CDNs** Issues with stacked CDNs were discussed, including logging inaccuracies, inability to block malicious traffic, and caching conflicts. David highlighted the challenges of using multiple CDNs and the impact on visibility and support.

* **Soft Purge Trade-offs** The soft purge option was explained as a method to mark cached items as stale while updates occur in the background. While it ensures speed, it may compromise accuracy, making it suitable for non-critical updates but not for urgent changes.

* **Case Studies of Merchants** David shared examples of high-performing and underperforming merchants using Adobe Commerce Cloud and Fastly. Successful merchants utilized aggressive caching and optimized GraphQL calls, while underperformers faced issues with uncacheable APIs, stacked CDNs, and rate-limiting misconfigurations.

* **Resources and Support** Attendees were directed to Fastly's developer documentation, Adobe's support team, and consulting services for further assistance. QR codes and links to resources were provided to help merchants optimize their websites and address specific challenges.
