## Key takaaways

### Marketing Channel Best Practices

* Normalize and simplify channel mapping for consistent data categorization.
* Use specific rules at the top and generic rules at the bottom of the priority list.
* Utilize special characters like semicolons and asterisks for concise rule creation.

### Segmentation

* Use segmentation to further categorize data for reporting in CRM and Discover.
* Common use cases include region-based segmentation and account size categorization.
* Segments can be applied to leads, contacts, and opportunities for tailored reporting.

### Custom Stage Mapping

* Define and organize lead, contact, and opportunity stages to track lifecycle milestones.
* Use custom stages to allocate revenue credit and touchpoint positions.
* Prioritize stages logically (specific to generic) and ensure proper classification (open, lost, converted).

### Touchpoint Suppression

* Suppress unwanted touchpoints to reduce noise and focus on actionable data.
* Common suppression rules include internal user suppression and time-based suppression.
* Suppression removes data from both CRM and Discover, while removal only blocks CRM data.

### General Recommendations

* Use best practices for clean and actionable data reporting.
* Leverage tools like boomerang stages for tracking reentry into lifecycle stages.
* Submit support cases for complex configurations or troubleshooting.
