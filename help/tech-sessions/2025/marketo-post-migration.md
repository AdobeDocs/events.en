## Key takeaways

* **Admin Console Purpose** Centralized management for Marketo users, admins, and identities, aligned with other Adobe products.

* **Roles in Admin Console**

  * **System Admin** Full access
  * **Product Admin** Manages specific products
  * **Profile Admin** Manages specific profiles
  * **Support Admin** Submits support tickets

* **Identity Types**

  * **Adobe ID** Personal account
  * **Enterprise ID** Company-managed without SSL
  * **Federated ID** Single sign-on (SSL)

* **Single Sign-On (SSL)** Requires directory setup, domain addition, and metadata file upload.

* **User Management** Add/remove users and admins via the Admin Console; convert Adobe ID to Federated ID using CSV files.

* **Support Process** Submit cases via Experience League Directory; "Support Admin" role required.

* **Common Issues**

  * Login problems due to ad blockers, mismatched identity types, or SSL errors.
  * Forgotten passwords or network password issues.

* **Certificate Renewals** SSL certificates need renewal every three years via the Admin Console.

* **User Groups** Organize users for specific tools; can be managed locally or synchronized with Active Directory.

* **Large User Base Management** Break user conversion into batches of 500 for efficiency.
