# A Deep Dive into Live Search

In this session, Adobe's Customer Technical Advisor, Tapan Sodagar, guides us through the ins and outs of customizing your Live Search experience. Adobe Commerce not only lets you use Live Search for information display and product discovery but also provides a unique opportunity to list Categories, CMS pages, and more through our open-sourced popover feature. This feature is designed for seamless collaboration with third-party system integrators, offering customization and additional implementation. Tapan demonstrates practical implementation examples using GraphQL queries and endpoints, providing valuable insights into what you can achieve with your eCommerce experience through our open API.
