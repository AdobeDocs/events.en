# Adobe Commerce Intelligence (fka MBI)

This is an in-depth webinar on Adobe Commerce Intelligence (formerly Magento Business Intelligence), a powerful tool designed to transform your eCommerce data into actionable insights. This session will equip you with the knowledge and skills to make the most of your data through intuitive dashboards and custom reports. Adobe Commerce merchants have access to four out-of-the-box dashboards and up to 50 reports through ACI. These reports cover everything from Product Performance to Average Order Value and can even be automatically distributed on a recurring schedule. We also showcase one of ACI's most exciting tools in its custom report builder, sharing how to use filters to create time-specific reporting that captures the most relevant data for your business goals. As always, we conclude with a live Q&A session to address your questions.
