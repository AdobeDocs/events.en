## Key takeaways

* **Challenges in Financial Services Modernization** Financial organizations face significant hurdles in modernizing their forms and communications due to the large number of forms across multiple systems, slow IT-driven updates, and high costs associated with scaling legacy systems. These challenges result in lost opportunities, such as uncaptured cost savings and revenue growth.

* **Impact of Poor User Experience** Key statistics highlight the importance of seamless digital experiences**

  * 67% of users abandon forms if complications arise.
  * In-person processing is 42 times more costly than digital.
  * Onboarding a customer in person costs $55 more than online.

* **AEM Forms Capabilities** AEM Forms is an end-to-end solution that drives operational efficiencies and exceptional user experiences. Key features include omnichannel forms, automated workflows, personalized customer communications, and integration with Adobe Experience Cloud and AEM Sights. These capabilities help organizations reduce form abandonment by 63%, increase self-service by 113%, and improve form completion speed by 58%.

* **Innovations in Form Design** The introduction of a cloud-based designer simplifies form creation with drag-and-drop functionality, fragments for reusable content, and integration with data models. This modernized tool reduces dependency on IT and enables faster updates, addressing the eight-week turnaround time for form changes in some organizations.

* **AI-Powered Enhancements** Adobe is leveraging AI to revolutionize form creation and user experiences. Features like the Experience Builder allow forms to be created using natural language prompts, while multimodal forms enable users to fill forms via chat, image uploads, and voice inputs. These innovations aim to improve efficiency, personalization, and user engagement.
