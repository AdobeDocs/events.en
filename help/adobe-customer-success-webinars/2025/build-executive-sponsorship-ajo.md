## Accelerating Transformation with Executive Sponsorship

Unlocking organizational change and customer-centricity requires strong executive sponsorship. Adobe's framework highlights how leadership, strategy, and collaboration drive value realization:

* **Executive Sponsorship** Senior leaders champion initiatives, set vision, and ensure strategic alignment.
* **Operating Model** Structured teams (executive sponsor, steering committee, working team) enable clear roles, faster decisions, and cross-functional collaboration.
* **Journey Optimizer (AJO)** Empowers organizations to deliver real-time, personalized, omni-channel customer experiences.
* **Change Management** Success depends on leadership involvement, stakeholder alignment, and sustainable change practices.

Applying these principles helps organizations overcome barriers, accelerate time to value, and deliver impactful customer experiences.


## Building Stakeholder Alignment

Effective stakeholder mapping is essential for driving experience-led transformation:

* **Identify Influencers** Map leaders with authority, strategic alignment, and capacity to champion initiatives.
* **Attributes of Sponsors** Look for vision, operational credibility, and customer advocacy.
* **Engagement Strategies** Tailor approaches to build coalitions, anticipate resistance, and accelerate adoption.
* **Relationship Building** Foster transparency, set clear expectations, and maintain ongoing communication to transform executive support into strategic partnership.

Using a stakeholder strategy map helps organizations select the right executive sponsor and allies, ensuring successful implementation and sustained change.
