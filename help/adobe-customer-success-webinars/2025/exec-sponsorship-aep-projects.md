## Key takeaways

* **Core Features of AEP and Real Time-CDP** These platforms offer real-time actionable profiles, data integration and unification, customer segmentation, personalization, predictive analytics, and strong data governance. These features can help organizations reduce costs, increase efficiency, and drive revenue growth.

* **Proof of Concept (POC) Development** Creating a POC involves gathering data, leveraging sandbox environments, and testing ideas in a controlled setting. This helps refine hypotheses and demonstrate the potential impact of features to stakeholders. 

* **Executive Sponsorship** Securing executive sponsorship is critical for project success.  Aligning the project with organizational goals, such as cost reduction or revenue growth, and presenting a refined pitch can help gain leadership support.

* **Change Management** Implementing new ideas requires a structured change management process to maximize adoption and minimize disruption.  This includes clear communication, building coalitions, and scaling ideas effectively.

* **Use Case Playbooks and Success Stories** Leveraging repositories of use cases and success stories can help refine ideas, provide business justification, and support pitches to executives.  These resources are valuable for both licensed and unlicensed users of the platform.
