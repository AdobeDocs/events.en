## Key Takeways

* **Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) Overview** CJA is an evolution of Adobe Analytics, focusing on the full customer journey across multiple touchpoints (e.g., mobile, web, CRM, call centers) rather than single-track events. It allows for real-time data processing and manipulation.

* **Migration Readiness** Key steps for migrating from Adobe Analytics to CJA include ensuring a strong identity identifier (e.g., person ID), aligning variables and dimensions, and mapping data to the XDM schema. Historical data can be imported with validation steps.

* **Data Views and Flexibility** CJA enables the creation of customizable data views with adjustable session durations, segmentation filters, and attribution settings. This flexibility allows for tailored reporting and analysis.

* **Best Practices for Historical Data Migration** Validate CJA data by comparing it with Adobe Analytics data within an acceptable range (e.g., 10% difference). Start with a short backfill window (e.g., one month) and scale up gradually.

* **Marketing Channel Attribution** CJA offers enhanced capabilities for marketing channel attribution, eliminating limitations like the "first page of visit" function and enabling more dynamic session configurations.
