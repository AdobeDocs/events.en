## Unlocking Value with Northstar Architecture

Northstar architecture is a foundational tool for organizations leveraging Adobe Experience Platform and AJO (Adobe Journey Optimizer) to drive business value.

* **Value Realization Framework** Developed from executive interviews, it identifies common barriers and guides organizations to unlock technology value.
* **Five Pillars** Roadmap to value, technology, resource investment, sponsorship, and organizational readiness.
* **Northstar Architecture (NSA)** Serves as a strategic, living diagram aligning business and technical teams, focusing on future state and use case-driven planning.
* **Industry Adaptability** NSA varies by vertical (e.g., travel, banking, retail), ensuring relevance to specific business needs.
* **Continuous Improvement** Regular updates keep NSA actionable and prevent technology implementations from becoming stale.

Understanding and applying Northstar architecture empowers organizations to plan, align, and execute technology strategies for measurable business impact.
