## Identity Graph Essentials

The identity graph is the backbone of customer data unification in Adobe Experience Platform. It links multiple identifiers—such as email, CRM ID, loyalty card, cookies, and device IDs—across channels and devices.

* **Identity Service** Builds the graph by connecting pairs of identifiers from data ingestion and events.
* **Profile Service** Merges profile fragments using the graph, assembling attributes, behaviors, and identities into a unified customer view.
* **Merge Policies** Decide how to resolve data conflicts, either by recency (timestamp) or dataset authority.
* **Business Impact** Proper configuration ensures accurate reporting, marketing eligibility, and compliance with regulations like GDPR.

## Unlocking Customer Data Connections

Discover how Adobe Experience Platform's identity graph rules unify customer data for deeper insights and better business outcomes.

* **Identity Graphs** Link customer interactions across devices and channels, creating a comprehensive profile.
* **Namespace Priorities** Business-driven rules determine which identifiers (email, CRM ID, loyalty card) anchor profiles and resolve conflicts.
* **Merge Policies** Control how data from different sources is combined, using timestamps or dataset precedence.
* **Graph Collapse & Remediation** Shared devices, unvalidated data, or implementation errors can fragment profiles; simulation tools and repair jobs help restore accuracy.

Understanding these concepts empowers organizations to maximize data value, ensure compliance, and deliver personalized experiences.
