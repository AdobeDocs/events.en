## Key discussion points

* **North Star Architecture (NSA) as a Strategic Tool** The NSA is a high-level architecture diagram that helps align business and technical teams by translating business goals, key business objectives (KBOs), and use cases into concrete technical requirements. It serves as a guiding framework for strategic planning, execution, and measurement of technology initiatives.

* **Use Case-Driven Approach** NSAs are intended to be driven by specific use cases, ensuring that every implementation has a clear value-driven reason. This approach avoids implementing features or solutions without a strategic purpose and prioritizes high-value use cases.

* **Customization and Context Dependency** The foundational architecture and NSA are tailored to the specific needs, verticals, and goals of each organization. Examples of NSAs vary in depth and focus, depending on the company's requirements, audience, and use cases.

* **Living Document** NSAs should be regularly updated to reflect current priorities and use cases. Stale or outdated architectures fail to serve their purpose, and reevaluating them during use case reprioritization ensures alignment and prevents implementation from becoming obsolete.

* **Value Realization Framework** The NSA is part of Adobe's broader value realization framework, specifically tied to the technology pillar. It helps address common barriers like misalignment between business and technical teams, mis-prioritization of efforts, and outdated implementations, ensuring organizations unlock maximum value from their technology investments.
