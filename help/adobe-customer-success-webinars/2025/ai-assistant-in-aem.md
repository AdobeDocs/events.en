## Unlocking AEM AI Assistant

Discover how the AEM AI Assistant streamlines product knowledge and support within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM):

* **Conversational Companion** Embedded directly in AEM, the AI Assistant provides instant answers to product and support queries.
* **Dual Agents** Includes a product knowledge agent for feature information and a support agent for ticket management.
* **Supported Solutions** Covers Experience Cloud Delivery Services, AEM Sites, Assets, Forms, Dynamic Media, and Cloud Manager.
* **Efficiency Gains** Reduces time to value and support load by enabling in-context help and ticket creation.
* **Simple Setup** Enabled via the Adobe Admin Console with clear user group and permission management.

Understanding these capabilities empowers teams to leverage AEM AI Assistant for faster problem-solving and improved productivity.

## Best Practices and Limitations

* **Clear Prompts** Provide specific, well-defined questions for the most accurate responses.
* **Refine Interactions** Adjust prompts to drill down or clarify as needed; review sources provided for confidence.
* **Scope Awareness** The assistant answers only within supported products and knowledge bases; it cannot access custom org data or unsupported products (e.g., Photoshop plugins).
* **No Content Generation** Currently, the assistant does not generate or author content—focus is on knowledge and support.

Future Enhancements: Additional features and broader capabilities are under consideration, with updates expected as the product evolves.
