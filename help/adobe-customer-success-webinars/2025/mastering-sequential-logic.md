# Mastering Sequential Logic in AA and CJA: A Visual Framework

Acquire a visual framework to translate your sequential analysis scenarios into a plan and then build the right sequential segments (filters).
 
* Quick review of sequential logic operations (THEN, ONLY AFTER, EXCLUDE, etc.).
* Visual framework to translate between sequential logic and use cases.
* Foundation for advanced use cases combining the sequential operators.

## Key takeaways

* **Sequential Logic in Analytics** The session focused on mastering sequential logic using the "then" operator to enable high-value analysis. This involves understanding how to define and analyze sequences of events in data.

* **Visualization of Report Data** The importance of visualizing data to understand and communicate sequential logic was emphasized. This includes organizing data by timestamps and understanding the flow of events.

* **Building and Validating Segments** A step-by-step approach to building and validating segments was discussed. This involves breaking down complex logic into manageable pieces, validating each step, and then combining them to form a comprehensive analysis.

* **Use Cases and Practical Applications** Two main use cases were presented - analyzing customer behavior after submitting an application and understanding customer journeys. These examples demonstrated how to apply sequential logic to real-world scenarios.

* **Future Sessions and Continuous Learning** The session is part of a series, with future sessions planned to cover more advanced topics such as logic groups, agile data, cohorts, and journey canvas. Participants were encouraged to provide feedback to shape these future sessions.
