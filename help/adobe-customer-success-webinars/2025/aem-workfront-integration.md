# AEM and Workfront integration using Native Connector

This webinar features a detailed walkthrough of the AEM-Workfront integration using the Native Connector. This session will deliver from a highly technical perspective: a detailed understanding of how the Native Connector works, what are the prerequisites and benefits of the Native Connector.

## Key Discussion Points

* Different types of integrations between AEM and Workfront
* Benefits of the Native Connector
* Prerequisites an overview for how to use the Native Connector

## Key takeaways

* **Integration Strategies** The session covered various integration strategies for Workfront, including native integration, custom integration using Fusion, and custom integration using REST APIs. Native integration is a no-cost, plug-and-play solution with several out-of-the-box integrations.

* **Native Connector Benefits** The native connector for Workfront and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) offers ease of setup, no additional licensing costs, automatic folder creation, metadata synchronization, and the ability to link multiple Workfront instances to multiple AEM repositories.

* **Metadata Mapping and Synchronization** The native connector supports unidirectional metadata flow from Workfront to AEM. Users can map Workfront fields to AEM fields, and metadata changes in Workfront are reflected in AEM.

* **Linked Folders and Guardrails** The session highlighted the importance of linked folders, the prerequisites for setting them up, and the guardrails, such as the 100-folder limit per integration and restrictions on special characters in folder names.

* **Use Cases and Demo** The demo showcased practical use cases, including uploading assets in Workfront and seeing them in AEM, updating metadata in Workfront and reflecting it in AEM, and the recommended way to delete assets (deleting in AEM rather than Workfront).
