## Unlocking Value with AJO Operating Models

AJO operating models are essential for translating strategic vision into effective, value-driven operations. Organizations face common barriers such as unclear roles, fragmented processes, and lack of governance, which can hinder personalization and resource efficiency.

* **Strategic Planning** Absence of planning leads to fragmented implementations and compliance gaps.
* **Role Clarity** Defined responsibilities and cross-functional collaboration are vital for seamless execution.
* **Governance** Structured workflows and meeting cadences drive accountability and continuous improvement.
* **Center of Excellence** Centralized frameworks accelerate maturity, standardize best practices, and foster innovation.

Understanding these pillars empowers organizations to maximize platform potential and drive measurable business outcomes.

## Governance & Team Evolution

Robust governance and evolving team structures are key to operational excellence:

* **Governance Cadence** Annual strategy workshops, quarterly roadmap reviews, monthly leadership check-ins, weekly progress updates, and daily team activities ensure alignment and accountability.
* **Campaign Workflow** Steps include campaign request, validation, prioritization, build, QA, execution, and reporting, mapped to roles using the RACI framework.
* **Team Evolution:
  * **Incubate** 2-3 broad-scope members, limited scalability.
  * **Scale** 5-10 dedicated members, moderate scalability, structured training.
  * **Embedded** 15-20 specialized members, high scalability, ongoing training.

Clear governance and team maturity drive consistent delivery and measurable results.
