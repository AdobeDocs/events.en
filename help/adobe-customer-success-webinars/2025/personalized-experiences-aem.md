## Key Points

* **Edge Delivery Overview** Edge delivery is a modern architecture designed to meet today's digital expectations, offering pre-rendered, versioned HTML pushed to a global CDN for faster, personalized, and dynamic content delivery.

* **Flexible Authoring Models** Adobe provides three main authoring models-Content Fragment Editor for structured content, Universal Editor for WYSIWYG editing, and Document-Based Authoring using tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Word - allowing teams to mix and match based on their needs.

* **Performance Improvements** Edge delivery is built as a performance-first architecture, addressing Google Core Web Vitals like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). Real-world examples showed dramatic improvements in web speed scores, bounce rates, and organic traffic.

* **Personalization at the Edge** Personalization is embedded in the delivery process, leveraging Adobe Target and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) for real-time audience segmentation, A/B testing, and tailored experiences without compromising performance.

* **AEM Sites Optimizer** A new tool that continuously scans sites for health, performance, SEO, and accessibility issues, providing actionable recommendations directly within the AEM dashboard to ensure ongoing optimization.
