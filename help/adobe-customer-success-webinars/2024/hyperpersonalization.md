## Key discussion points

* The modern customer journey has evolved and is no longer a linear path. Successful customer journeys rely on unique customer analysis and the ability to map individual customer journeys.
* Customer loyalty is declining, especially among Gen Z consumers. It is important for businesses to focus on personalization to retain customers and increase their share of wallet.
* Personalization should go beyond basic personalization, such as using a customer's name in an email. Hyper personalization, or 1-to-1 personalization, is the goal, where customers have a unified and consistent experience across all touchpoints.
* To achieve hyper personalization, organizations need to prioritize customer experience, align their internal processes and capabilities, and integrate technology, people, and processes.
* The path to hyper personalization involves assessing the organization's current state, aligning on a shared vision, mapping the customer experience and architecture, and optimizing internal processes.  It is important to prioritize based on customer experience and measure the success of personalization efforts.
