# Mastering Sequential Logic in AA and CJA: Foundations

Gain a foundational understanding of THEN and related sequential logic operators in Adobe Analytics (sequential segments) and Customer Journey Analytics (sequential filters). Sequential logic enables high value analysis in Adobe Analytics and Customer Journey Analytics, but it is underutilized and often misunderstood. This webinar will establish the foundations of how these operators are evaluated in Analysis Workspace.

## Key Takeaways

* **Session Focus** The session was focused on mastering sequential logic and analytics in Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), led by Andy Powers.
* **Sequential Logic Basics** The session covered foundational aspects of sequential segmentation and filtering in analytics and CJA, including:

  * The use of the "then" operator.
  * How "after" and "within" modifiers work.
  * The "only before" and "only after" sequence options.

* **Practical Examples** Andy provided practical examples and demos to illustrate how to use these features in the tool, emphasizing the importance of practicing in one's own environment.
* **Complexity and Practice** The topic is complex and requires practice to master. Andy suggested starting with small, known data sets to validate and understand the segment definitions.
* **Business Applications** Sequential logic can help answer various business questions, such as customer behavior after specific events, comparing groups based on sequences of actions, and analyzing customer journeys.
* **Advanced Topics** Future sessions may cover more advanced topics like using exclude in sequences, non-repeat instances, and additional tips and examples.
* **Feedback Request* Attendees were asked to fill out a survey to provide feedback on the session and express interest in future topics.
* **Resources** Links to resources for both analytics and CJA sides of sequential segments or filters were provided for further study.
