## Additional Insights

### Mindset for Effective Admins

Success as a Workfront admin requires a strategic mindset,

* **Curiosity Over Criticism** Understand why systems were set up a certain way before making changes.
* **Support Over Sovereignty** Act as a guide, not a gatekeeper, to empower users and align systems with business goals.
* **Strategy Over Survival** Shift from reactive problem-solving to proactive system design that enhances user experience.

These mindset shifts help admins uncover hidden opportunities, build trust with teams, and create scalable, user-friendly systems.

### Building a Governance Team

A strong governance team ensures your Workfront instance remains effective and scalable,

* **Key Players** Include project managers, system admins, operations leads, and executive sponsors.
* **Defined Roles** Assign responsibilities for configuration, adoption, data analysis, and system health.
* **Communication Channels** Use dashboards, regular meetings, or governance projects to track progress and share insights.
* **Training and Enablement** Provide ongoing education through Experience League, workshops, and certifications.
* **Governance Guidelines** Establish policies for managing changes, onboarding users, and maintaining system integrity.

This team will anchor your optimization efforts and drive continuous improvement.
